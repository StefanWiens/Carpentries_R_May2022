As part of the Stockholm Trio (SU, KI, KTH), I helped organize this [course](https://kth-biblioteket.github.io/2022-05-16-StockholmTrio/).

This was run under [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

I taught R and Rmd. The present repository contains the course material. 

I started off from this excellent [material](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

However, I adapted it to this course.
