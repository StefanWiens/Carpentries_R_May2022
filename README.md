## Carpentries R May 2022

https://stefanwiens.github.io/Carpentries_R_May2022/

As part of the Stockholm Trio (SU, KI, KTH), I helped organizing this course:

https://kth-biblioteket.github.io/2022-05-16-StockholmTrio/

This was run under: https://carpentries.org/

I taught R and Rmd. This repository contains the course material. 

I started off from this excellent material: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/
However, I adapted it to this course.
